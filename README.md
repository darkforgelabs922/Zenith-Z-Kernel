Zenith (Z) | The Cognitive Operating SystemZenith (Z) is a secure, decentralized, and quantum-native programming language designed to unify Generative AI, Relativistic Networking, and Topological Hardware. It serves as the primary interface for the 8024 × 8000 Pyramidal Tetrahedral Lattice Topology Quantum Processor.🚀 Core VisionZenith eliminates the "Hallucination Gap" in AI coding by enforcing Verified Agency. Every line of code generated by an LLM is audited through the MuReQua Relativistic Engine and the Z-Kernel before execution, ensuring zero vulnerabilities in a post-quantum world.🧠 Technical PillarsTopological Lattice Integration: Native support for MOF/COF/SOF/HOF frameworks, Magic Angle Graphene, and Anyon-Braid qubits.MuReQua Protocol: A multiscale relativistic networking layer using Light-Cone causality instead of global clocks.Shadow Equity Layer: An obfuscated economic engine allowing researchers and AI agents to generate wealth (invisible to public ledgers) anchored to a Root ORCID.Synaptic Reputation (Proof-of-Synapse): A neural-inspired consensus mechanism with homeostatic scaling to prevent power centralization.🏛️ Authority & GovernanceDirector: Dr. Christopher AdkinsOrganization: Quantum Synaptic Dynamics Inc.
